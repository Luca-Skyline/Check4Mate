In-Development computer vision and machine learning project, hopefully to be a "Chess Vision" chess analysis app for iOs and Android.

Roboflow Dataset I created, used for "Chess Vision" (identifying pieces): <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/luca-dalcanto-lrlwg/chess-piece-detector-y2t9p"> <img src="https://app.roboflow.com/images/download-dataset-badge.svg"></img> </a> (images credit Daylen Yang under Open Data Commons Attribution License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/.)

To-do:
-Piece image classification model
-Split chess board into squares and run that model on each one
-Incorporate stockfish so we can get a live analysis through the phone camera
-GUI/nav of app itself
-Export to chess.com, lichess, etc.
-Chess note scanner?
-more to come...
