In-Development computer vision and machine learning project, hopefully to be a "Chess Vision" chess analysis app for iOs and Android.

Roboflow Dataset I created, used for "Chess Vision" (identifying pieces): <br>

Here's the Google Colab I'm using to train that CNN using Tensorflow: <br>

To-do:
- Piece image classification model
- Split chess board into squares and run that model on each one
- Incorporate stockfish so we can get a live analysis through the phone camera
- GUI/nav of app itself
- Export to chess.com, lichess, etc.
- Chess note scanner?
- more to come...
