        "The code contained in this jupyter notebook was used to create the Deep Learning image classification model used in check4mate, an app in development by Luca DalCanto.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code uses YOLOv5, a leading Neural Network for object detection and segmentation, but uses it instead for image classification. A dataset with around 25000 images is loaded from Roboflow, with each image labeled as one of 13 classes (6 pieces of two colors, plus the \"empty square\" class). The \"medium\" size of YOLOv5 model is fit with this data over 40 epochs, and the .pt file is then exported for use in my app.\n",

        "You can find the dataset I used on Roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/luca-dalcanto-lrlwg/chess-piece-detector-sv3nm/dataset/4. This is my Roboflow project, but the images themselves are attributed to someone else (see below).\n",
        "\n",
        "This data has been preprocessed and augmented with the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Preprocessing: Grayscale\n",
        "*   Preprocessing: Resize to 224x224 pixels (this should not do anything with my particular dataset but it's a good safety)\n",
        "*   Augmentation: 90°, 180°, 270° Rotation\n",
        "*   Augmentation: Brightness 20%\n",
        "*   Augmentation: Exposre 4%\n",
        "*   Augmentation: Blur 0.3px\n",
        "\n",
        "The preprocessing homogenizes the images, and the augmentation allows to have more images by duplicating some of the images with changes such as rotation and shear (the CNN needs to be able to identify a chess piece from any overhead angle).\n",
